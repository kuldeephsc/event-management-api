## API Endpoints

### Authentication

#### Signup

```http
POST /signup
```

Request Body:

```json
{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "123456"
}
```

---

#### Login

```http
POST /login
```

Request Body:

```json
{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "123456"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "message": "Login successful",
  "token": "jwt-token"
}
```

---

## Event APIs

### Get All Events

```http
GET /events
```

---

### Get Single Event

```http
GET /events/:id
```

---

### Create Event

```http
POST /events
Authorization: <jwt-token>
```

Request Body:

```json
{
  "name": "Go Workshop",
  "description": "Learning Go",
  "location": "Bangalore",
  "dateTime": "2026-01-01T15:30:00.000Z"
}
```

---

### Update Event

```http
PUT /events/:id
Authorization: <jwt-token>
```

---

### Delete Event

```http
DELETE /events/:id
Authorization: <jwt-token>
```

---

### Register for Event

```http
POST /events/:id/register
Authorization: <jwt-token>
```

---

### Unregister from Event

```http
DELETE /events/:id/register
Authorization: <jwt-token>
```

---

## JWT Authentication

JWT token is generated during login and validated using middleware.

Protected routes:

- Create Event
- Update Event
- Delete Event
- Register for Event
- Unregister from Event

---

## Password Security

Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storing them in the database.

---

## Important Fix

JWT claims return numeric values as `float64`.

```go
userId := int64(claims["userId"].(float64))
```

Without this fix, authenticated APIs may return:

```text
500 Internal Server Error
```

Because type assertions in Go are extremely polite right until they detonate your application.

---

## Sample Authorization Header

```http
Authorization: your-jwt-token
```

## Future Improvements

- Refresh Tokens
- Role-Based Authorization
- Docker Support
- Swagger Documentation
- Unit Testing
- PostgreSQL Support
- Environment Variables for Secrets
